In [*Executable Rust Code in Quarto*](https://galenseilis.github.io/blog/posts/rust-execution-for-quarto/) I made a rough implementation of having Rust code compiled and its output rendered.

With some small adjustments we can do the same for other languages, including C. Here is a "Hello, World" example.

```{c}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
