## WIP

This post is a work in progress. I am experimenting with rendering Rust code. It still needs some work.
:::


Here is some Rust code that will be executed and rendered.

```{rust}
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.
    // Print text to the console.
        println!("Galen Seilis is learning Rust!");
}
```



Now let us try some Rust code that will not be executed.


```rust
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.
    // Print text to the console.
    println!("Meow");
}
```
