In [*Executable Rust Code in Quarto*](https://galenseilis.github.io/blog/posts/rust-execution-for-quarto/) I made a rough implementation of having Rust code compiled and its output rendered.

With some small adjustments we can do the same for other languages, including C++. Here is a "Hello, World" example.

```{cpp}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Similar to the lessons learned from the Rust implementation, there is plausibly a better implementation with an entirely different starting point.
