//! # Rust Simulation Framework
//!
//! This crate provides a flexible framework for simulating discrete-event systems (DES).
//! It allows users to schedule, manage, and execute events over time, making it suitable for
//! simulations of various systems such as queueing networks, resource allocation systems, and more.
//!
//! The core components of the framework are:
//! 
//! - [`Event`]: A struct representing a single event in the simulation, holding its scheduled time, an action, and context.
//! - [`EventScheduler`]: A struct that manages the execution of events, prioritizing those scheduled to run earlier.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Event Scheduling:** Schedule events at specific times or after delays.
//! - **Event Logging:** Keep a log of all events executed and their outcomes for later analysis.
//! - **Flexible Execution:** Run the scheduler until a certain condition is met, such as reaching a max time.
//! - **Contextual Information:** Attach metadata (context) to each event for richer event processing.
//! 
//! ## Usage Example
//!
//! Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create an event, schedule it in the `EventScheduler`, and run the simulation.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use desru::{Event, EventScheduler};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut scheduler = EventScheduler::new();
//!     let action = Box::new(|| {
//!         println!("Event executed!");
//!         Some("Event completed.".to_string())
//!     });
//!
//!     let event = Event::new(5.0, Some(action), None);
//!     scheduler.schedule(event);
//!     scheduler.run_until_max_time(10.0);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Core Structs
//! - [`Event`]: Defines the core event object used to represent scheduled actions.
//! - [`EventScheduler`]: Manages the execution of events over simulated time.
//!
//! ## Customization
//! You can extend the framework by adding custom event types or adjusting how events are scheduled.
//!
//! ## Design Goals
//! This framework is designed to be:
//! 
//! - **Simple to use:** By providing straightforward methods to schedule and run events.
//! - **Flexible:** Allowing users to define custom event behaviors.
//! - **Efficient:** Using a priority queue to ensure events are executed in the correct order.
//!
//! ## Design Non-Goals
//! This framework is only for the very most core components for DES, and will not provide
//! implementations of simulation tools.
//!
//!
//! ## Future Directions
//!
//! Planned features include:
//! - **Advanced Scheduling Policies:** Adding support for different event scheduling strategies.
//! - **Performance Optimizations:** Improving efficiency for larger simulations.
//!
//! ## Crate Overview
//! This crate provides essential components for event-driven simulations in Rust. Starting
//! with events and a scheduler, and abstractions that provide weak coupling with state, this crate
//! can be used to implement most conceivable discrete event simulations.

/// - `context`: A map containing any extra contextual information as key-value pairs (both as `String`).
/// - `active`: A boolean indicating if the event is active. If false, the event will not run.
