I am experimenting with rendering Rust code. It still needs some work.\n:::\n\n\nHere is some Rust code that will be executed and rendered.\n\n\n```{rust}\nfn main() {\n    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.\n    // Print text to the console.\n        println!(\"Galen Seilis is learning Rust!\");\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\nNow let us try some Rust code that will not be executed.\n\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.\n    // Print text to the console.\n    println!(\"Meow\");\n}\n```\n\n",
