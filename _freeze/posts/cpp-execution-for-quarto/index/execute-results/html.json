Here is a \"Hello, World\" example.\n\n\n```{cpp}\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Hello, World!\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n\nSimilar to the lessons learned from the Rust implementation, there is plausibly a better implementation with an entirely different starting point.\n\n",
