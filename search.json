    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a short blog post to remind myself how to compile CPython from its source.\nYou need to get the source files for Python as you need to give the C compiler (and other tools) the needed instructions for producing machine code. The CPython source is available on Github. Using git, you can download with\n$ git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git\nYou should install build-essential which provides tooling for building Debian packages. This can be done with apt:\n$ sudo apt install build-essential\nNext install these assorted packages:\n$ sudo apt install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev libdb5.3-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libffi-dev\nHere is a brief description of each package:\n\n\n\nInstall\nPackage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlibssl-dev\nSecure Sockets Layer toolkit - development files\nThis package is part of the OpenSSL project’s implementation of the SSL and TLS crypographic protocols for secure communication over the internet.\n\n\nzlib1g-dev\nCompression library - development\nzlib is a library implementing the deflate compression method found in gzip and PKZIP.\n\n\nlibncurses5-dev\nTransitional pacakge for libncurses-dev\nPackage prociding libncurses5-dev.\n\n\nlibncursesw5-dev\nTransitional package for libncurses-dev\nPackage providing libncursesw5-dev.\n\n\nlibreadline-dev\nGNU readline and history libraries, development files\nThe GNU readline library aids in the consistency of user interface across discrete programs that need to provide a command line interace\n\n\nlibsqlite3-dev\nlibsqlite3-dev\nSQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine.\n\n\nlibgdbm-dev\nGNU dbm database routines (development files)\nGNU dbm (‘gdbm’) is a library of database functions that use extensible hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX ‘dbm’ functions.\n\n\nlibdb5.3-dev\nBerkeley v5.3 Database Libraries [development]\nThis is the development package which contains headers and static libraries for the Berkely v5.3 database library\n\n\nlibbz2-dev\nHigh-quality block-sorting file compressor library - development\nStatic libraries and include files for the bzip2 compressor library\n\n\nliblzma-dev\nXZ-format compression library - development files\nXZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful compressoin (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.\n\n\nlibffi-dev\nForeign Fucntion Interface library (development files)\nThis package contains the headers and static library files necessary for building programs which use libffi\n\n\n\nNow run the configuration tool that the Python dev’s have kindly prepared. It will prepare a makefile for everything you need to build CPython.\n$ ./configure --with-pydebug\nThe --with-pydebug tells configure to use a debugging hook.\nFinally, you can just run make.\n$ make\nThat’s pretty much it. If you want to silence the large standard output, you can add an -s. By default make will compile the first target specified in the make file, which for this project is actually the entirety of CPython itself. You can specify special build targets related to building, testing, installation, and other topics."

You can either initialize a Kedro project first and then add the package manager, or add the package manager first and use kedro-init to fill in a Kedro project. Which one is more appropriate will depend on what already exists in your project. Kedro should be compatible with PEP-compliant packages (see discussion here) and also Poetry.

The first is that Rust code blocks will be run regardless of whether echo: false is used. The second is that all the outputs are being rendered on a single, notwithstanding Quarto’s line wrapping.\nThere is also an enhancement which is desirable, which is to render other types of things from Rust that are not just plaintext. Instead of developing this kind of functionality myself, it would make sense to take a closer look at integrating tools such as the Evcxr Jupyter kernel."

    "text": "I recently learned that setting up Rust execution in Quarto is easy via evcxr_jupyter.\nThe first thing you need to do is ensure that Rust is installed. See Install Rust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t hurt to run rustup update if you have not updated in a while.\n\n\nThen you can use Cargo to install relevant crate. Expect this step to take a while.\n$ cargo install evcxr_jupyter\nThen, if necessary, add the executable evcxr_jupyter to PATH. On Debian-based Linux put the following in your .bashrc file\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin/\nand run source .bashrc.\nThen use the binary to install the Jupyter tool.\nevcxr_jupyter --install\nAt this point it should be installed. You’ll see a Rust kernel will be available when you use jupyter notebook and Quarto will similarly recognize Rust code in {rust} as being executable. Start with something like a “Hello, World” example. You’ll find that in the Rust REPL you will not need to specify main {...}.\n\nprintln!(\"Hello, World.\");\n\nHello, World.\n\n\nYou can control the code echo by using //| echo: true and //| echo: false near the beginning of the code block."

    "text": "In a previous post I showed how to start the most basic Flask web application. In this post I show a dynamic URL which renders content that depends on using the URL as user input. The mathematical function known as factorial is defined as\n\\[n! \\triangleq \\prod_{i=1}^n i\\] when \\(i \\geq 1\\) and when \\(n=0\\) then \\(0! \\triangleq 1\\). We will set a dynamic URL which takes an integer for which the factorial will be calculated and displayed. We can specify this by passing '/factorial/&lt;int:number&gt;'. The prefix /factorial/ is just to remind us that we’re calculating the factorial of a number. The angle brackets &lt;TYPE:...&gt; indicate that something is unspecified input in between the brackets with type TYPE. In this case we want &lt;int: ...&gt; because the factorial function (not to be confused with its generalizations, like the gamma function) is defined only for non-negative integers. It is natural to use number since we expect a number, but other names are possible for this.\nfrom math import factorial\n\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/factorial/&lt;int:number&gt;')\ndef calculate_factorial(number):\n    return str(factorial(number))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\nThat’s it. We’re just taking the number, calculating its factorial, casting the result to a string, and returning it. Flask takes care of the rest."

This expression does not by itself suggest one algorithm over another due to the cummutativty and associativity of the operators involved.\nWikipedia gives pseudocode for computing the probability mass function for the Poisson binomial distribution via what it terms the “direct convolution algorithm”.\n\nfn dc(p: &[f64]) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt; {\n    let n = p.len();\n    let mut pmf: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![1.0]; // PMF array with size 1, initialized to 1\n\n    for i in 0..n {\n        // Create a new next_pmf array with size i + 2\n        let mut next_pmf: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![0.0; i + 2]; \n\n        // Calculate the first element of next_pmf\n        next_pmf[0] = (1.0 - p[i]) * pmf[0];\n\n        // Calculate the last element of next_pmf if within bounds\n        if i &lt; pmf.len() {\n            next_pmf[i + 1] = p[i] * pmf[i];\n        }\n\n        // Update the rest of next_pmf\n        for k in 1..=i {\n            next_pmf[k] = p[i] * pmf[k - 1] + (1.0 - p[i]) * pmf[k];\n        }\n\n        // Update pmf for the next iteration\n        pmf = next_pmf;\n    }\n\n    pmf\n}\n\nLet’s try to use the algorithm.\n\n// Example usage\nlet p: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4];\nlet pmf: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = dc(&p);\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", pmf);\n\n[0.3024, 0.4404, 0.2144, 0.0404, 0.0024000000000000007]\n\n\nWe can also double check that the result resembles a probability by checking if the sum of the probabilities is in fact equal to unity.\n\nlet sum_check: f64 = pmf.iter().sum(); // Calculate the sum of the PMF values\nprintln!(\"Sum of PMF: {}\", sum_check);\n\nSum of PMF: 1\n\n\nWe can also define the cumulative distribution function (CDF) as the cumulative sum of the PMF.\n\nfn compute_cdf(pmf: &[f64]) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt; {\n    let mut cdf: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(pmf.len());\n    let mut sum = 0.0;\n\n    for &prob in pmf {\n        sum += prob;\n        cdf.push(sum);\n    }\n\n    cdf\n}\n\nHere is an example of using the CDF.\n\nlet cdf: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = compute_cdf(&pmf);\nprintln!(\"CDF: {:?}\", cdf);\n\nCDF: [0.3024, 0.7428, 0.9572, 0.9976, 1.0]\n\n\nOften we will want to be able to sample from such a probability distribution.

That is the case if you are running Python in a Quarto block.\nSo similar to what I have done with other languages, we can define a script which we can import into a given blog post in order to call other processes. When we run our asynchronous “Hello, World” script we will want to also capture its standard output in our interactive session.\nWith Python this is pretty straightforward because we don’t need to consider compiling code ourselves, much less linking object files. The following is a good start:\nimport subprocess\n\ndef run_python_file(file_path):\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            [\"python\", file_path],\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            check=True\n        )\n        return result.stdout\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred while running the file: {e.stderr}\"\nPutting this code in ../../scripts/run_python.py, we can call it like this:\n\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(1, '../../scripts')\nimport run_python\n\nprint(run_python.run_python_file('example.py'))\n\nHello,\nWorld!\n\n\n\nThis setup is fine for simple and isolated blogging examples. Anyway, that’s about as close as I think we’ll get to a “Hello, World” script with Asyncio. As with similar scripts that I have written for Rust and other languages, Quarto’s automatic freezing feature will only look for if the source of the QMD file has changed. Quarto will ignore any example Python files outside of that."

Where it is used in the above quantitative fault tree pertains to the AND gates. There are two AND gates in the diagram.\nThe first AND gate (going from left-to-right) is the one which produces the probabiliy for a medication error. You’ll note that the propositions\n\\[M = D \\cap W\\]\nand\n\\[\\Pr [M] = \\Pr [D] \\Pr [W]\\]\nare assumed to hold in that the proposition\n\\[5 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.01 \\times 0.005.\\]\nThe second AND gate feeds into the surgical error node. The probability of a surgical error is similarly assumed to satisfy\n\\[S = E \\cap H\\]\nand\n\\[\\Pr [S] = \\Pr [E] \\Pr [H]\\]\ndue to observing that\n\\[3.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.02 \\times 0.015.\\]\nSometimes statistical independence is a great assumption, but sometimes it is an assumption that we definitely should not make. When we cannot make the assumption of statistical independence of events we should consider a different approach."

It could be said in this case that the events are mutually exclusive.\nTwo events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are considered almost-surely disjoint if-and-only-if\n\\[\\mu \\left( E_1 \\cap E_2 \\right) = 0.\\]\nfor a choice of measure \\(\\mu\\). This might look very similar to the disjoint case that we just covered. However, they are not the same. See Seilis (2022) for some examples, noting that for our purposes we would take \\(\\mu\\) to be a probability measure.\nIf two sets of disjoint, then they are also almost-surely disjoint:\n\\[E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\emptyset \\implies \\mu \\left( E_1 \\cap E_2 \\right) = 0\\]\nSwitching to considering unions, related to the OR gates, it holds for two almost-surely disjoint events that\n\\[\\Pr [E_1 \\cup E_2] = \\Pr [E_1] + \\Pr[E_2].\\]\nYou can verify that this countable additivity is used at the OR gates in the example diagram. Further, this type of result will hold for any countable collection of events (i.e. not just for two events).\nJust like statistical independence, almost-sure disjointedness is not always an assumption we can make. It depends on the problem, which motivates us to want to find a more general mathematical tool."

In general these assumptions will not hold, but it depends on the problem. Other approaches such as Judea Pearl’s causal graphs combined with Bayesian networks (also developed by Pearl) could replace everything that I think is essential to these quantitative fault trees without loss of generality."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis post was migrated from my iNaturalist journal to my Jekyll blog on 2023-02-26. It was then migrated to my Quarto blog on 2024-07-27.\n\n\nSuppose you have an exported CSV of iNaturalist observations, observations-&lt;ID&gt;.csv.\nTo follow this tutorial you will have to have Python installed, and the Matplotlib and Pandas packages installed. Pandas is not necessary, but it makes things convenient enough that I recommend using it here. In other contexts you may wish to plot pie charts without Pandas.\nAssuming you have PIP installed, you can install Pandas and Matplotlib as follows:\npip install matplotlib pandas\nAlthough, since Pandas actually uses Matplotlib as a dependency for plotting, it might suffice to simply use:\npip install pandas\nNext, you must create a script file with the *.py extension. We can do fancier things with paths, but let us create the file pie_taxa.py using BASH.\ntouch pie_taxa.py\nNow let us write some lines of code in pie_taxa.py. First we need to import the required packages.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nNext we can load our data using the pd.read_csv function, which assumes a CSV format by default. It has many other parameters, including changing the delimiter (see the docs), but we are fine with the defaults here.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"observations-&lt;ID&gt;.csv\")\nNow, as if by magic (but actually the hard work of software developers), we can create the plot in a single line of code. Let us do it for the kingdom level, which will require us knowing that this is represented by the taxon_kingdom_name column in our data file.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"observations-&lt;ID&gt;.csv\")\ndf['taxon_kingdom_name'].value_counts().plot.pie()\nThere are a few things going on in the previous line of code. First is that df['taxon_kingdom_name'] has selected only the taxon_kingdom_name column. This is next passed to the value_counts() which counts the occurrences of each kingdom in that column and returns a Pandas series object with this information, and then we finally call the plot.pie method on this series object which… well… makes the pie chart.\nIf you run the code at this point you may be surprised to not actually see a plot appear anywhere. If you ran the code from the command line you might have seen something like &lt;AxesSubplot:ylabel='taxon_kingdom_name'&gt;. This is because creating the instructions of what goes on the drawing canvas is different from graphically rendering it. In order to do that, we can call plt.show().\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"observations-&lt;ID&gt;.csv\")\ndf['taxon_kingdom_name'].value_counts().plot.pie()\nplt.show()\nRunning the above, you should see a window pop up. It has various settings for resizing, reshaping, zooming, and saving your figure.\nWhat if you didn’t want to look at Kingoms, but rather orders, or families, etc? You would simply use a different column instead of taxon_kingdom_name. Here is a table of these similar columns:\n\n\n\nTaxonomic Rank\n\n\n\n\ntaxon_kingdom_name\n\n\ntaxon_phylum_name\n\n\ntaxon_subphylum_name\n\n\ntaxon_superclass_name\n\n\ntaxon_class_name\n\n\ntaxon_subclass_name\n\n\ntaxon_superorder_name\n\n\ntaxon_order_name\n\n\ntaxon_suborder_name\n\n\ntaxon_superfamily_name\n\n\ntaxon_family_name\n\n\ntaxon_subfamily_name\n\n\ntaxon_supertribe_name\n\n\ntaxon_tribe_name\n\n\ntaxon_subtribe_name\n\n\ntaxon_genus_name\n\n\ntaxon_genushybrid_name\n\n\ntaxon_species_name\n\n\ntaxon_hybrid_name\n\n\ntaxon_subspecies_name\n\n\ntaxon_variety_name\n\n\ntaxon_form_name\n\n\n\nHappy plotting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nNumba is a Python library that provides an open source just-in-time compiler that allows a coder to mark selected parts of their code to be compiled for faster execution. As someone interested in computation at any scale, from calculating \\(13 \\times 19\\) (mental arithmetic is not my forte) to analyzing the behaviour of tens of thousands of genes or hundreds of thousands of IP addresses. I am not one to squeeze every inch of performance out of something small that was only meant to run once as a proof of concept, but it can be worth speeding up tasks that are either huge or will be repeated.\nLet’s get into how to use Numba – hang on! Why not just use compiled languages like C, C++ or FORTRAN? Well, herein lies one of meta-problems of development that requires some optimization. Coding in Python is useful for quickly coding up proofs of concept, but properties like its dynamic typing slow it down compared to memory-managed code in C. Coding in C will give a faster execution for the same code, but will often require more time and degugging to get ready for deployment. Using Python with Numba is an attempt to get the best of both worlds, and in practice is not much slower than software compiled from well-written low-level languages.\n\n\nJIT\nThe first way we can use Numba to speed up our code is by compiling a function so that future executions can use the compiled version, removing the need to compile at runtime. Let’s take a function that gives us the first n Fibonnacci numbers, and see how it performs.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom timeit import timeit\n\ndef fib(n):\n    '''\n    Adjusted from:\n    https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numba.html\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number\n    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/\n    '''\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return np.ones(1)\n    elif n &gt; 1:\n        x = np.empty(n)\n        x[0] = 1\n        x[1] = 1\n        for i in range(2,n):\n            x[i] =  x[i-1] + x[i-2]\n        return x\n    else:\n        print('WARNING: Check validity of input.')\n\nprint(timeit('fib(10)', globals={'fib':fib}))\n\n2.0311123809988203\n\n\nRunning the above code on my laptop gives around 2 seconds to run the function \\(1000000\\) times according to timeit, which is reasonable for small \\(n\\) but let’s see if we can speed this up with the Numba’s jit.\n\nfrom numba import jit\nimport numpy as np\nfrom timeit import timeit\n\ndef fib(n):\n    '''\n    ARGUMENTS:\n    n: Max index to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to (int)\n    RETURNS\n    x: Array of Fibonnacci numbers (numpy.ndarray)\n\n    NOTES:\n    Adjusted from:\n    https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numba.html\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number\n    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/\n    '''\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return np.ones(1)\n    elif n &gt; 1:\n        x = np.empty(n)\n        x[0] = 1\n        x[1] = 1\n        for i in range(2,n):\n            x[i] =  x[i-1] + x[i-2]\n        return x\n    else:\n        print('WARNING: Check validity of input.')\n\nfib = jit(fib)\n\nprint(timeit('fib(10)', globals={'fib':fib}))\n\n0.6980576210007712\n\n\nRunning the above code with jit brought the execution time down to about 0.7 seconds, which is faster than the original function.\n\n\nVectorizing\nAnother approach to speeding up code is vectorizing, where multiple operations are applied to each entry directly instead of producing multiple intermediate arrays as operations are applied. Originally I had wanted to use our fib function, but I quickly learned that it is not vectorizable because it cannot be made into a universal function. For a function to be universal, it is necessary that they map scalars into scalers, and map arrays into arrays. With that in mind, we’ll vectorize a suitable function to show how the time performance is improved. Let’s start by timing the unvectorized function.\nimport numpy as np\nimport quantecon as qe\n\ndef f(x, y):\n    return np.exp(np.abs(x -y**3)) *  np.cos(x**2 + y**2)\n\n# generate data\ngrid = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)\nx, y = np.meshgrid(grid, grid)\n\nstart = qe.util.tic()\nf(x, y)\nend = qe.util.toc()\nOn my machine the execution time was about \\(0.05\\) seconds, which isn’t half-bad by itself. Not let’s run the same code in vectorized form.\nfrom numba import vectorize\nimport numpy as np\nimport quantecon as qe\n\n@vectorize\ndef f(x, y):\n    return np.exp(np.abs(x -y**3)) *  np.cos(x**2 + y**2)\n\n# generate data\ngrid = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)\nx, y = np.meshgrid(grid, grid)\n\nf(x,y) # precompile\n\nstart = qe.util.tic()\nf(x, y)\nend = qe.util.toc()\nThis vectorized form took about \\(0.0042\\) seconds to execute, which is about \\(12\\) times faster! This is a clear demonstration that vectorizing functions is worthwhile as scalability becomes an issue.\nBecause the vectorization of this function means that each element of the array is calculated independently, we can further attempt to speed this calculation up by calculating elements in parallel! We do that by telling the decorator the element types (we’ll use float64), and that the target is function should be done in parallel.\nfrom numba import vectorize\nimport numpy as np\nimport quantecon as qe\n\n@vectorize('float64(float64, float64)', target='parallel')\ndef f(x, y):\n    return np.exp(np.abs(x -y**3)) *  np.cos(x**2 + y**2)\n\n# generate data\ngrid = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)\nx, y = np.meshgrid(grid, grid)\n\nf(x,y) # precompile\n\nstart = qe.util.tic()\nf(x, y)\nend = qe.util.toc()\nThis last acceleration to make the calculations parallel squeezed the execution time down to \\(0.0031\\) seconds. This is only \\(0.0011\\) seconds faster than without the parallel execution, but still a worthwhile addition to the toolkit for doing independent calculations.\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing Numba allows us an easy way to increase the performance of functions in Python without going to a lower-abstraction language such as C or FORTRAN. Some functions will be more suitable to @jit than @vectorize based on the type of operations and whether the function is universal (or can be made into a universal function). These accelerations in performance becomes increasingly valuable as the amount of data being processed becomes large!"

In this post we’ll take a number and GET/POST different templates depending on whether the input number is a prime number.\nTo check that a number is prime we can first check whether the candidate is less than 2. For natural numbers the number 2 is the smallest prime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the complex numbers, \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), the number 2 is not a “Gaussian prime”. It can be factored:\n\\[2 = (1 + i) (1 - i)\\]\n\n\nThe next criterion is that we only need to check whether there exists a natural number \\(k\\) such that \\(k^2 &lt; n\\) and \\(k | n\\). If such a number \\(k\\) does not exist, then \\(n\\) is a prime number.\nIn this example I prepared two templates:\n\ntemplates/example_is_prime.html\ntemplates/example_is_not_prime.html\n\nThe directory templates is in the same directory that the Flask application will be run.

    "text": "Back in May 2020 I released a video on YouTube for the HackSeq event:\n\n\nBut I figure I could give some written description as well, which is what the rest of this blog post covers.\nA graph is a 2-tuple containing a set of edges and a set of vertices, and the set of edges is a subset of the cartesian product of the set of vertices with itself. We can think the vertices as ‘things’ and the set of edges as a binary relation between them.\nSometimes graphs are called “networks” when either the vertices (often called “nodes” when discussing networks) or edges have additional attributes, however this usage is not universally accepted. Three common properties of graph edges are whether they are directed, signed, or weighted. In the case of directed edges, some sort of ‘directionality’ is associated with the edges, and we’d say that (u,v) and (v,u) are considered distinct for two vertices u and v from the graph. A graph with directed edges is called a directed graph or a digraph. In the case of signed edges, each edge is assigned a ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ value, and we call such a graph a signed graph. In the case of weighted edges, each edge is assigned a numerical value, and we call such a graph a weighted graph. If a graph doesn’t have directed, signed, or weighted edges and doesn’t have multiple edges for any given pair of vertices, then it is called a simple graph.\nA graphlet is a specific type of graph, inheriting all the properties of graphs but also being a weakly-connected induced subgraph. For a graph to be subgraph, there exists another graph such that the subgraph’s vertex set is a subset of the other graph’s vertex set and the subgraph’s edge set is a subset of the other graph’s edge set. A subgraph being induced can be thought of procedurally, by first selecting any subset of the vertices and then also selecting all edges that connect those selected vertices. The property of weakly-connected can be considered for any graph, and means that there exists a path between any pair of vertices in the graph.\nA function is injective if it satisfies that f(x)=f(y) implies that x=y.\n\n\n\nhttps://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/Injection_1000.gif\n\n\nA function is surjective if it satisfies for any element b in the image that there exists an element a of the domain for which b=f(a).\n\n\n\nhttps://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/Surjection_1000.gif\n\n\nA bijection is a function that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) from one set to another (these two sets can be the same set).\n\n\n\nhttps://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/Bijection_1000.gif\n\n\nA graph isomorphism is a bijection f between two graphs (which can be the same graph in the case of graph automorphisms) such that any two vertices u and v in the first graph are adjacent if-and-only-if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent.\n\n\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Graph_isomorphism_a.svg\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Graph_isomorphism_b.svg\n\n\nA graph automorphism is a graph isomorphism where the domain graph and the image graph are the same graph.\n\n\n\nhttps://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/GraphAutomorphismGridGraph_1000.gif\n\n\nAn equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. An equivalence class is a subset of a set such that all members of the subset adhere to an equivalence relation. A (vertex) orbit automorphism is an equivalence class from the vertex set of a graph under the action of a graph automorphism. Multiple graph automorphisms are possible, and the set of all automorphisms with composition of permutations of the vertex set is called a permutation group.\nSince graphlets are graphs, and orbit automorphisms can be found within graphs, we can find orbit automorphisms within graphlets. The idea behind enumeration of orbit automorphisms of graphlets is to count the number of times each vertex of a graph participates in each orbit automorphism of each graphlet from a set of graphlets. While each finite graph has a finite number of distinct (i.e. mutually non-isomorphic) graphlets, considering every conceivable graphlet would be computationally infeasible. Instead of considering all graphlets of a graph, a constraint is often imposed where graphlets containing only 2-3 vertices are considered.\nEnumeration of orbit automorphisms of graphlets has been used to characterize correlation networks of coexpression of genes, and characterize the role of traders in the world trade network."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post I will show you how to simulate an autoregressive (AR) process using Matplotlib and NumPy.\nFirst, let’s define a function which pseudorandomly generates the data sequence. We’ll set an intercept parameter to set a consistent offset of the series from zero, and a sequence of autoregressive coefficients. The order of the coefficients entails the lag order that they are each applied to, so if you want to skip a lag order you can just set it to zero. Some AR series are noisier than others, and you can set that level of noise using the noise parameter. In this model we assume that the noise is a stationary normal distribution:\n\\[\\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\]\nfor all \\(t\\).\nThe following implementation is a generalization of the implementation provided in Generate Fake Autoregressive Data in which I have allowed for any number of time lags. I have also allowed a user-provided random number generator to be passed.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef simulate_ar(\n    intercept: float,\n    coefs: List[float],\n    noise: float = 0.3,\n    warmup: int = 10,\n    steps: int = 200,\n    rng=None\n    ) -&gt; np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Simulates an autoregressive (AR) time series.\n\n    Args:\n        intercept (float): The intercept term of the AR process.\n        coefs (List[float]): List of coefficients for the lagged terms.\n        noise (float, optional): The standard deviation of the Gaussian noise. Default is 0.3.\n        warmup (int, optional): Number of initial steps to discard to allow the process to stabilize. Default is 10.\n        steps (int, optional): Number of steps to simulate after the warmup period. Default is 200.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Simulated AR time series data of length `steps`.\n    \"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng() if rng is None else rng\n    max_lag = len(coefs)\n    draws = np.zeros(warmup + steps)\n    draws[:max_lag] = intercept\n    for step in range(max_lag, warmup + steps):\n        draws[step] = intercept + rng.normal(0, noise)\n        for lag, coef in enumerate(coefs, start=1):\n            draws[step] += coef * draws[step - lag]\n    return draws[warmup:]\n\nLet us set a seed for reproducibility.\n\nRANDOM_SEED = 2018\nrng = np.random.default_rng(RANDOM_SEED)\n\nNow let’s choose some parameters.\n\n# True parameters of the AR process\nintercept = 10\ncoefs = [-0.3, 0.1, -0.3]  # Example coefficients for AR process with 3 lags\n\nNow let us simulate the AR process.\n\nar_data = simulate_ar(intercept, coefs, warmup=2018, steps=200, rng=rng)\n\nFinally, let us plot the simulated data using Matplotlib.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))\nax.set_title(\"Generated Autoregressive Timeseries\", fontsize=15)\nax.plot(ar_data)\nax.set_xlabel('Time')\nax.set_ylabel('Signal')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis implementation is not particularly efficient in terms of computing resources. Although performance is influenced by many things, a large factor is the presence of an ordinary for loop. Upon every iteration of the loop the Python interpreter will check that all types are still valid, which is a waste of computing resources when you can assume that they are. Perhaps I will write a more efficient function, but this example should be suitable for examples and tinkering for now.\n\nHere is the output data for the example:\n\nar_data\n\narray([6.941708  , 6.3155875 , 6.79896769, 6.62115125, 6.64690478,\n       6.79654732, 6.32163015, 6.72852581, 6.35004628, 6.89721308,\n       6.92979629, 6.97466588, 6.47919687, 6.24134393, 6.91045418,\n       6.43927381, 6.55083547, 6.53331397, 6.44255904, 6.58915744,\n       6.4923775 , 7.07488836, 6.32039603, 7.21035304, 6.27709664,\n       7.0134047 , 6.68872494, 6.97816857, 6.75025929, 7.00950853,\n       6.39465926, 6.68118717, 6.85268958, 6.46779684, 6.76181945,\n       7.29674199, 6.64142503, 6.58699206, 6.72707155, 5.87192126,\n       6.49363922, 6.28287734, 7.18342675, 6.70507765, 6.94382677,\n       6.39717353, 6.49306093, 7.02621907, 6.8610425 , 6.87523356,\n       6.7267247 , 6.46888024, 6.8280871 , 6.7789368 , 6.77176061,\n       6.58257732, 6.33784174, 6.808397  , 6.62658717, 7.53212642,\n       6.59001865, 7.09541224, 6.4240351 , 6.40443905, 6.08217251,\n       7.13828813, 7.09221513, 7.08928927, 6.21026942, 6.76872715,\n       6.28272682, 6.77029136, 6.46984318, 7.0331383 , 6.85807573,\n       6.64286023, 6.3238929 , 7.03278515, 6.54674528, 6.97528036,\n       7.11517396, 6.22263056, 6.74882539, 6.66139963, 7.0783666 ,\n       6.23980551, 6.67212967, 6.46792713, 6.66990209, 6.77251836,\n       6.94614928, 6.83357381, 6.89816709, 6.15734245, 6.86025094,\n       6.93488203, 6.46304183, 6.91241082, 6.47560317, 6.89390062,\n       7.12772216, 6.41811335, 7.40498293, 6.42844055, 7.2251552 ,\n       6.87492573, 6.15158164, 6.82079686, 6.790811  , 6.90070107,\n       6.37238571, 6.42500936, 6.56438666, 6.35378324, 7.26239073,\n       6.54888149, 6.80957892, 6.20860224, 7.48779131, 6.84955546,\n       6.94570356, 6.72697226, 6.27613628, 6.89544594, 6.75888508,\n       7.07931692, 6.66666166, 6.3180758 , 6.19398727, 7.09355878,\n       6.49304741, 7.55478488, 6.35099042, 6.92931065, 6.00868397,\n       6.86902339, 6.99545602, 6.95783505, 6.64467603, 6.47337945,\n       6.78201172, 6.63753378, 7.48158873, 6.51522663, 7.05250727,\n       6.39296225, 7.3519113 , 6.66425586, 6.48041592, 6.17408598,\n       6.45883478, 6.22486773, 6.54137246, 6.34066406, 6.96759892,\n       6.72473722, 6.98529234, 6.58060658, 6.59542768, 6.54721287,\n       6.88949907, 6.43898143, 7.00231541, 6.1544984 , 6.68328599,\n       6.12233025, 6.16702292, 6.64338878, 7.31158216, 6.90580583,\n       6.62631565, 6.80756359, 6.87177271, 6.57651991, 6.29329644,\n       6.78533065, 6.8948178 , 6.61792592, 7.0182514 , 6.22628874,\n       6.86051622, 6.49121734, 7.16799008, 6.20211378, 7.30671013,\n       6.12323977, 7.34758837, 6.16358606, 6.88596075, 6.71944393,\n       6.36211338, 7.12466492, 6.27294854, 7.01723785, 6.84008439,\n       6.80771285, 5.93900768, 6.51765076, 6.92400731, 6.54072599])"

Petgraph is a popular graph data structures and algorithms crate available for Rust.

    "text": "As someone with previous background in Python, I’ve been blasting my way through the basics of the Quantecon curricula. One of the joys of self-directed learning is that, with discipline, you can speed through familar material and really camp out with the new material. With that in mind, I’ve decided to further play with finding solutions (x-intercepts) of some single variable functions.\nFirst of all, let’s find ourselves an interesting function. I’ve chosen \\(f(x) = \\sin(x) \\exp(-x)\\) because I’ve always enjoyed its degradating oscillations, but also because I expect this equation to have solutions. Since any integer multiple \\(k\\) of \\(\\pi\\) will result in \\(\\sin(x) = 0\\) when \\(x = k \\pi\\), we know that \\(f(k \\pi) = 0\\) as well. While I’m quite late (or too early, depending on how you see it) for calculating \\(\\pi\\) on \\(\\pi\\) Day, let’s take \\(k = 1\\) to find \\(\\pi\\) anyway!\n\nBisection Method\nThe first method mentioned on QuantEcon is the bisection algorithm, which essentially treats finding solutions to a function as a binary search problem. There are two parameters that are needed to get started with the bisection algorithm, an initial lower bound and an initial upper bound on the search space. Not only do we need two such parameters, but our choice of these two numbers can change what solution is found. Let’s consider the following example where we look on the interval \\([-10, 10]\\).\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import bisect\n# Define a single-variable function to find solutions in\nf = lambda x: np.sin(x) * np.exp(-x)\n# try out the bisection algorithm\nprint(bisect(f, -10, 10))\n\n0.0\n\n\nWe were looking for \\(x = \\pi\\), but we got \\(x = 0\\) instead. If there are multiple solutions within your search interval, the algorithm won’t necessarily converge on the one that you wanted, nor will it report to you there were multiple solutions. Knowing ahead of time that we’d like to calculate \\(\\pi\\), and that \\(3 &lt; \\pi &lt; 4\\), let’s rerun the bisection algorithm on \\([3, 4]\\).\n\nprint(bisect(f, 3, 4))\n\n3.1415926535901235\n\n\nThat gives us a value pretty close to \\(\\pi\\), correct to the \\(11\\)th digit anyway.\n\n\nNewton-Raphson method\nThe Newton-Raphson method is a calculus-based method that iteratively steps towards a solution. Like the bisection method, it requires a number decided ahead of time but this time this chosen number is an initial guess or starting point. Unlike the bisection method, the Newton-Raphson method does not have bounds set on the search so a continuous function over the real numbers can be searched indefinitely. To prevent the algorithm searching for too long, a hyperparameter limiting the number of iterations (steps) is included if a stable solution is not converged upon (default is \\(50\\) steps).\n\nfrom scipy.optimize import newton\n# Define a single-variable function to find solutions in\n# try out the Newton-Raphson algorithm\nprint(newton(f, 0.2))\n\n3.6499361606787994e-14\n\n\nWhile \\(x = 0.2\\) is not that far off from Pi, the local derivatives are going to point the steps to descend toward zero. Notice that the solution we got was not exactly zero, but rather the first solution found within a predefined tolerance of \\(1.48 \\times 10^{-8}\\). What you don’t see from the code is the that shape of the curve, which if you plot our function you’ll see there is a local maxima between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = \\pi\\) at \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Relative to this hill, our estimate is analogous to a ball rolling in the direction of steepest descent. This analogy breaks down for solutions separated by a local minima as the method is not equivalent to steepest descent even though it is based on the local derivative. Another issue that can come about is picking an initial value close to an extrema because the results can be unstable, allowing incredibly large jumps across the domain. Therefore, we should be cautious about our choice of initial guess by doing some exploration of function’s properties before attempting to estimate the solution. Let’s retry with a more suitable initial value.\n\n# try out the Newton-Raphson algorithm\nprint(newton(f, np.pi / 4 + 1))\n\n3.1415926535897936\n\n\nThat is clearly closer to \\(\\pi\\) than \\(3.6499361606787994 \\times 10^{-14}\\), and being accurate for the first \\(16\\) digits suggests that it was more precise than the bisection algorithm under these parameters.\n\n\nBrent’s method\nThe QuantEcon course points out that Bisection is more robust (stable) than Newton-Raphson’s method, but it is also slower. An alternative approach that balances this tradeoff is Brent’s method which includes bounds and garantees solutions for computable functions. Let’s give this approach a try on our function on \\([3, 4]\\).\n\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n# try out the Brent's algorithm\nprint(brentq(f, 3, 4))\n\n3.141592653589788\n\n\nLooks like this estimation of \\(\\pi\\) was correct for the first \\(13\\) digits, which was better than Bisection but worse than Newton-Raphson.\n\n\nPerformance comparison with timeit\nLast of all, it would be interesting to compare the time performance of each of these solution-finding approaches. Let’s do that with timeit.\n\nfrom timeit import timeit\nprint(timeit(stmt='bisect(f, 3, 4)',\\\n    globals={'bisect':bisect, 'f':f},\\\n    number=100000) / 100000)\nprint(timeit(stmt='newton(f, np.pi / 4 + 1)',\\\n    globals={'newton':newton, 'f':f, 'np':np},\\\n    number=100000) / 100000)\nprint(timeit(stmt='brentq(f, 3, 4)',\\\n    globals={'brentq':brentq, 'f':f},\\\n    number=100000) / 100000)\n\n0.00010017173054002341\n0.0001319278220400156\n2.3580086980000487e-05\n\n\nWe find under this setup that the slowest algorithm was the Newton-Raphson’s method, followed by the bisection method by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), and final Brent’s method being about an order of magnitude faster! So Brent’s method gave us more accurate digits in the solution, at least for \\(x = \\pi\\), and also performed faster than the other two methods. Does this mean that Brent’s method is always the best method? Not necessarily. We should be open to the possibility of tradeoffs not discussed on QuantEcon, as well as there being a panoply of algorithms out available in code repositories."

    "title": "Build and Run a Rust Project from Quarto Using Python",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous post I used a Lua extension to compile a Rust file using the rustc compiler. I ran into multiple problems.\nUsing rustc rather than Cargo means that I miss out on a lot of the build tools, and it is also less conventional for Rust projects.\nThere were also issues with my plugin. It did not correctly turn off echo either locally to a code block, or to the global setting in the preamble of the Quarto file. It also did not put code on a new line. Further, I got feedback that this might not be supported. I also learned from a discussion answer on the Quarto Github discussion board that there are tools that might be better.\nWhile other tools like evcxr look appealing, I have not looked into how to exactly integrate it with Quarto yet.\nBut there is a low-hanging fruit we can take advantage of here. We can certainly use Python subprocess library to indirectly orchestrate building and running a rust project. It also allows us to capture the output as text and return that into a Jupyter notebook. So that’s exaxtly what I made:\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport stat\n\ndef log_permissions(path):\n    st = os.stat(path)\n    permissions = stat.filemode(st.st_mode)\n    print(f\"Permissions for {path}: {permissions}\")\n\ndef compile_and_run_rust(target_file):\n    # Get the directory and the file name\n    target_dir = os.path.dirname(target_file)\n    target_name = os.path.basename(target_dir)  # Adjusted to get the correct target name\n\n    # Ensure Cargo.toml exists in the target directory\n    cargo_toml_path = os.path.join(target_dir, 'Cargo.toml')\n    if not os.path.exists(cargo_toml_path):\n        raise FileNotFoundError(\"Cargo.toml not found in the target directory.\")\n\n    # Compile the Rust project\n    try:\n        build_process = subprocess.run(\n            ['cargo', 'build', '--release'],\n            cwd=target_dir,\n            check=True,\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True\n        )\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Compilation Error: {e.stderr}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the compiled executable\n    target_exe = os.path.join(target_dir, 'target', 'release', target_name)\n    if os.name == 'nt':\n        target_exe += '.exe'\n\n    if not os.path.exists(target_exe):\n        raise FileNotFoundError(\"Compiled executable not found.\")\n\n    if os.name != 'nt':\n        try:\n            os.chmod(target_exe, stat.S_IRWXU | stat.S_IRGRP | stat.S_IXGRP | stat.S_IROTH | stat.S_IXOTH)\n            os.chmod(os.path.dirname(target_exe), stat.S_IRWXU | stat.S_IRWXG | stat.S_IRWXO)\n        except PermissionError as e:\n            print(f\"Error setting permissions: {e}\")\n            return\n\n    # Run the compiled executable and capture its output\n    try:\n        run_process = subprocess.run(\n            [target_exe],\n            check=True,\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True\n        )\n        output = run_process.stdout\n        return output\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Execution Error: {e.stderr}\")\n        return\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    output = compile_and_run_rust('../posts/rust-run-from-python/hello/main.rs')\n    print(output)\nPython Jupyter notebooks run Python in interactive mode, so it is slightly less convenient for importing Python files. Nonetheless this can be done by inserting our script into the path using the sys library. Once we have imported the run_rust file, we can call the compile_and_run_rust pointing to a Rust project path that is locally stored\nLet us start a Rust project called “hello”.\ncargo init hello\nI also added a loop with a println macro just so we can see how this approach handles keeping newline characters. Here is the Rust code in hello/src/main.rs.\nfn main() {\n\n    let mut count = 0;\n\n    loop {\n        count = count + 1;\n        println!(\"{} Hello, world!\", count);\n        if count &gt; 11 {\n            break\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe above Rust code should print a series of lines each starting with a number, with the numbers ranging from 1 to 12.\nWith all that setup, we can now try using the run_rust.compile_and_run_rust process caller.\n\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(1, '../../scripts')\n\nimport run_rust\n\nprint(run_rust.compile_and_run_rust('./hello/'))\n\n1 Hello, world!\n2 Hello, world!\n3 Hello, world!\n4 Hello, world!\n5 Hello, world!\n6 Hello, world!\n7 Hello, world!\n8 Hello, world!\n9 Hello, world!\n10 Hello, world!\n11 Hello, world!\n12 Hello, world!\n\n\n\nAnd there we have it! We can further try again, but with #| echo: false in the Python code block to turn off echo:\n\n\n1 Hello, world!\n2 Hello, world!\n3 Hello, world!\n4 Hello, world!\n5 Hello, world!\n6 Hello, world!\n7 Hello, world!\n8 Hello, world!\n9 Hello, world!\n10 Hello, world!\n11 Hello, world!\n12 Hello, world!\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, this approach using Python itself and Python Jupyter notebooks to compile, run, and display the printed output from a Rust program. It succeeds in preserving newline characters, and echo works locally. It also works globally for the whole file. The only remaining thing to watch out for in particular if Quarto’s automatic freezing of posts will not detect if you have changed the Rust code; you may need to change your qmd file in some way."
