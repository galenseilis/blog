    "text": "I am switching to Quarto for my blog. My Jekyll blog is available here, and I might move some of the posts over to the new blog over time.\nCreating this blog was really easy. Was my Jekyll blog really complicated to setup? There were some technical hurdles around getting extra behaviour on my original blog, but overall it wasn’t extremely hard. Why am I switching to Quarto?\nWhat Quarto provides (that I want) is code execution followed by rendering the output of the code. I can put my code examples right into the blog post, and if something like a plot is produced then that plot will show on my blog.\nIn constrast, with Jekyll, I needed to\n\nmake the plot\nmove the plot to an images folder\nreference to the plot’s path in the blog post.\n\nIt wasn’t terrible, and it is possible that I just didn’t figure out how to make this easier with Jekyll, but it was quickly apparent to me that Quarto makes this easy.\nThis includes mermaid diagrams:\n\n---\ntitle: Example Git diagram\n---\ngitGraph\n   commit\n   commit\n   branch develop\n   checkout develop\n   commit\n   commit\n   checkout main\n   merge develop\n   commit\n   commit\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: Example Git diagram\n---\ngitGraph\n   commit\n   commit\n   branch develop\n   checkout develop\n   commit\n   commit\n   checkout main\n   merge develop\n   commit\n   commit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can also easily prepare Graphiz diagrams provided that I supply some valid dot notation:\n\ndigraph finite_state_machine {\n    fontname=\"Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif\"\n    node [fontname=\"Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif\"]\n    edge [fontname=\"Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif\"]\n    rankdir=LR;\n    node [shape = doublecircle]; 0 3 4 8;\n    node [shape = circle];\n    0 -&gt; 2 [label = \"SS(B)\"];\n    0 -&gt; 1 [label = \"SS(S)\"];\n    1 -&gt; 3 [label = \"S($end)\"];\n    2 -&gt; 6 [label = \"SS(b)\"];\n    2 -&gt; 5 [label = \"SS(a)\"];\n    2 -&gt; 4 [label = \"S(A)\"];\n    5 -&gt; 7 [label = \"S(b)\"];\n    5 -&gt; 5 [label = \"S(a)\"];\n    6 -&gt; 6 [label = \"S(b)\"];\n    6 -&gt; 5 [label = \"S(a)\"];\n    7 -&gt; 8 [label = \"S(b)\"];\n    7 -&gt; 5 [label = \"S(a)\"];\n    8 -&gt; 6 [label = \"S(b)\"];\n    8 -&gt; 5 [label = \"S(a)\"];\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinite_state_machine\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\n\n0-&gt;2\n\n\nSS(B)\n\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n0-&gt;1\n\n\nSS(S)\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n6\n\n6\n\n\n\n8-&gt;6\n\n\nS(b)\n\n\n\n5\n\n5\n\n\n\n8-&gt;5\n\n\nS(a)\n\n\n\n2-&gt;4\n\n\nS(A)\n\n\n\n2-&gt;6\n\n\nSS(b)\n\n\n\n2-&gt;5\n\n\nSS(a)\n\n\n\n1-&gt;3\n\n\nS($end)\n\n\n\n6-&gt;6\n\n\nS(b)\n\n\n\n6-&gt;5\n\n\nS(a)\n\n\n\n5-&gt;5\n\n\nS(a)\n\n\n\n7\n\n7\n\n\n\n5-&gt;7\n\n\nS(b)\n\n\n\n7-&gt;8\n\n\nS(b)\n\n\n\n7-&gt;5\n\n\nS(a)"

    "text": "Integrating Causal Inference Methods into Northern Health’s Analytics Work\n\n\nObjective: This talk aims to highlight the integration of modern causal inference methods into the decision-making processes at Northern Health (NH). I present a comprehensive approach to incorporate causal inference principles into NH’s analytics work, emphasizing the significance of causality in healthcare research and its alignment with NH’s mission, vision, and strategic plans.\nMethods: The presentation outlines our approach, which involves the development of a systematic causal model development process. These methods are designed to equip NH’s data scientists and researchers with the skills necessary to apply modern causal inference techniques effectively.\nResults: I discuss the theoretical foundations and the framework for integrating modern causal inference methodologies into NH’s projects. I highlight the general challenges and benefits of applying causal inference methods in healthcare research, including addressing incomplete or corrupted data, accounting for unmeasured confounds, and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects at the individual level. Finally, I will report on the current state of a project to estimate the causal impact of COVID-19 on a time series data set in NH.\nLessons Learned: Causality has deep roots in philosophy, and modern causal inference offers a rigorous framework to address the complexities of healthcare data analysis. I emphasize the critical distinction between causal inference and traditional statistics and demonstrate how misleading statistics can misguide decision-making. I stress that causal inference methodologies are in harmony with NH’s mission, vision, and strategic objectives, enhancing the quality of inferences drawn from healthcare data.\n\n\nA Friendly Introduction to Statistical Forecasting\nA Moosy Proposal: Estimating Average Direction of Moose Travel from Weak Information\nAdventures in Non-Negative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition\nHow Correlation Really Works\nIntroduction to Interval Arithmetic\nIntroduction to Using ARIMA\nExample of Training a SARIMAX Model\nReview of a Study Using SARIMAX Guest lecture: Relations and Graphs\nA Gentle Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning{:target=“_blank”}\n\n\n\n\nPractical Approaches to Faster and Leaner Python{:target=“_blank”}\n\n\n\n\nA Gentle Introduction to L-Systems{:target=“_blank”}\nEnumeration of Automorphism Orbits of Graphlets (HackSeq){:target=“_blank”}"
